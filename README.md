# C

These are my solutions for the exercises in The C Programming Language, Second Edition, also known as K&R.

## Motivation

I believe this book will not only teach you the C programming language, but also how to program. It's like you're not just learning how to catch a type of fish, but you learn about fishing - potentially hunting - in general.

At the moment of writing this readme, I had just changed my job. That meant switching projects, coding standards, cultures, etc. I felt desperate to grow in order to bring more value to the table. I wanted to see and understand every kind of system. That's why I wanted to finish K&R - to learn more about creating efficient & effective systems.

### Desired outcome
    
An improvement in my [systems thinking](https://youtu.be/vJ1STks8MUU) skills.
