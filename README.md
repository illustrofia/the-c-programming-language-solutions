# Solutions to The C Programming Language, Second Edition

These are my solutions for the exercises in The C Programming Language, Second Edition, also known as K&R.

The solutions are written in C and Rust. Why Rust? Because practice and fun.

## Motivation

I believe this book will not only teach you the C programming language, but also how to program. It's like you're not just learning how to catch a specific type of fish, but you learn how to fish â€“ maybe even how to hunt.

### Desired outcome

Improvements in the following areas:

- systems thinking
- programming skills
